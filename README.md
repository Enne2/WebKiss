HTML Static Page Generator and CMS implementing a totally KISS and universal logic for language native and hackable developing
---
This essential PHP CMS-code generator is a simple, begineer friendly solution. 

 1. Frontend are made manually.
 2. Uses a YAML content to add static variables definitions and values.
 3. This variables could be linked to markdown files (they will be converted in HTML on compling). I can edit that file to inject HTML content in the page.
 4. A PHP script can be added and execute to this recipe for generate more variables.
 5. After doing this a html document is generated and saved in a folder to be published
 
 In other words we have a fronted template with variable placeholders, we load a yaml with definition of static variables and generation of html variabes from markdown files, whe execute a php script t generate some other variables. Put it all toghether and output a static web page.
 The user will have a frontend wysiwg editor to edit markdown files and a code editor for yaml files.
